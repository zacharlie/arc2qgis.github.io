# Arc2OSS
{{< /blocks/title >}}

Arc2OSS, previously known as Arc2QGIS, is a community initiative for producing and providing tools and documentation that will facilitate the transition for users familiar with proprietary spatial software products to using Open Source alternatives.

The initial implementation of the project was a collection of manuals specific to reproducing the processes available in the ArcGIS Pro Desktop Application using Open Source alternatives, but was since expanded to include opinionated guides and information on full stack spatial information systems.

To fully realise the implication application of the project, it is necessary to first have some understanding on Open Source systems.

# About Open Source
{{< /blocks/title >}}

{{< center cols="8" >}}
{{% wrapper classes="p-5" %}}
Open Source is a term used to refer to software in which the source code used to produce applications is published in an open and transparent way. Because of the low cost of distribution and reproducibility, open source applications are often made available free of cost (gratis), but the concept is typically used to refer to free software in the sense of liberty (libre) that allows for extensibility, collaboration, and prevents vendor lock-in.

The terms and initialisms for Free or Libre Open Source Software may include FOSS, LOSS, FLOSS, OSS, OS, and other variations on the term. Open Source ecosystems are often reliant on various concepts of software freedoms and code is released under various license agreements, each with their own implications and restrictions.

# OSS Challenges

{{% wrapper classes="p-5" %}}
Proprietary ecosystems often rely on business strategies that involve vendor lock-in and make it simple to get started with their systems and importing data, but often make it difficult to migrate away from those systems.

In many instances, proprietary systems may be prohibitively expensive for certain use cases, but more often than not the business has interest to invest resources into trying to "onboard" new users and ensure that they build familiarity with a certain product range and making it difficult to switch.

Open Source ecosystems operate in contrast to this, in that many projects are community driven and promote the utilisation of open and interoperable standards.

Because nobody "owns" a solution, and because features are built democratically and transparently, and often in a piecemeal fashion, there may be various forms of fragmentation in the open source ecosystems which pose challenges for new users.

- Technology is hard
- There are often multiple solutions to a problem
- There are many competing platforms
- There is a lack of, too much, or inconsistent documentation
- Community users are often technical experts with some features developed with less beginner-friendly approaches
- Some functionality is obsolete or relies on legacy systems

Ideally, all data sources, infrastructure, and processes would be configured and managed in a way that ensured interoperability, open standards compliance, and optimal cost-value benefits. This allows the necessary proprietary functionalities to be executed on discrete processes, whilst the bulk of operations are handled using open systems.

Of course, businesses have incentive to prevent this from happening. Sadly, in many instances, this may lead to price gouging whereby a company provides personal incentives to individuals with access to public funding or influence over other system users. There are far more considerations to the total cost of ownership for a system than software costs, as training, maintenance, opportunity costs, and other costs also play a role.

Open Source projects also do not often have the same level of exposure, as all budget is typically allocated to product development and not marketing, relying on a projects utility or technical merit almost exclusively to gain momentum.

This can make it challenging and intimidating for new users to enter the open source ecosystem and leverage freely available resources.

{{% wrapper classes="p-5" %}}
By providing opinionated workflows, this project aims to:  

- Lower barrier for entry to FOSSGIS
- Outline levels of system feature parity
- Improve FOSS project exposure
- Facilitate Open Source Education
- Prevent vendor lock-in and price gouging
- Promote interoperable infrastructure

# OSS Myths
{{< /blocks/title >}}

{{< center cols="8" >}}
{{% wrapper classes="p-5" %}}
There are a few myths and misconceptions about open source ecosystems that should be addressed.

The "You get what you pay for" argument is certainly not true, as in open source ecosystems many institutions, from private companies to academic institutions, private individuals, or the world bank and unicef, may have invested incredible amounts of capital into producing and maintaining open source products. In addition, price gouging and corruption, especially in the public sector, aggravate already impractical business practices in a way that almost certainly does not benefit the wider community in an optimal way.

Many quality arguments and issues also arise from a number of challenges, including:

- User familiarity
- Unopinionated design
- Too much flexibility
- High barrier for entry
- High technical skill requirements
- Unopinionated workflows
- Bugs are discussed in public
- Quality control
- User testing
- Community contributions
- Lack of content curation
- No funding or incentive for value added services

There are certainly issues in open source development, such as users not wanting to fix challenging but boring issues,

# Get Involved
{{< /blocks/title >}}

{{< center cols="8" >}}
{{% wrapper classes="p-5" %}}
This is a community project run by volunteers and anyone is free to get involved by collaborating and contributing to the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/arc2oss/arc2oss.github.io).  
  
It takes time to produce good software and add new functionalities. Open Source businesses may offer consultancies which will produce functionality for a fee and publish the resulting source code from the outcomes for the benefit of the larger community, but if nobody pays for functionality to developed it may take a long time for that functionality to be built by volunteers. You can help projects grow by getting involved - not all contributions are code!
